2 months of studying and wokring with prodcedural generation compiled into a small portfolio showcasing my best work. Some of the projects were done in Glitch (no longer functional) and ported into Vscode and some were started and completed in Vscode. Credit to Wes Modes for starter code. 

[Experiment 1] - A very simple introduction to proc gen in the form of a recipe generator.
