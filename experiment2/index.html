				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this experiment was to generate an accurate, yet simple rendition of a field of sunflowers, a common sight in the countryside of France where I grew up. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The most important and interesting part of the process was creating the sunflowers. First I used the arc function to randomly place yellow circles all around a certain area of the canvas with the end angle set to random to make them look more realistic. I then created a smaller brown circle at each flower to complete the look of the sunflower. I also set the size of eacch flower to be a certain fraction of their y coordinate so that they would get a little smaller the further back they were. The last important aspect of the flowers is how they appear to be bunched up towards the back, giving a greater sense that you are looking at the field at an angle. I have no idea how this happened and cannot remember how I implemented this by looking at my code. I believe there is a reason for it, I just can't figure it out.</p>
				<p>The trees on the horizon were a simple matter of creating more circles and messing with the randomization and other variables to acquire a proper look. I had wanted to add vertices to each cricle using the arc function to give the tress a more jagged look, but unfortunately the function I was using did not want to cooperate with me.</p>
				<p>The clouds in the sky were another matter of randomly placing large circles and messing with the numbers. I tried to get some of the clouds to stick to one another to create a more realistic appearance.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working on this was a lot more fun than I thought it would be, though also as frustrating as I thought it would be. working with so many random() funtions and other variables can mess with your head after a while.</p>
				<p>Getting the right color for the sky turned out to be a bit tricky at first although I'm glad I went for it becuase I really like the look of the gradient. Also clouds and terribly difficult to get right and they're the only things I really had regrets about by the end.</p>
