				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>An oldschool jrpg overworld generator. Inspired by the early Final Fantasy games and other retro titles, this generator creates islands and coastal biomes filled with trees, houses, and dark towers. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This generator makes use of the noise() function as well as autotiling logic to generate a tiled, coherent landscape. The autotiling logic makes use of bitwise shifting to create a code for each tile as well as four different tile banks depending on the context (water, grass, forest, etc.). 
					The noise() function is used for the water tiles, grass tiles, and forest tiles. The noise value is configured at noise(i/8, j/8) to create a nice balance between x and y directions. The houses and towers were placed using the random() function set to 5% and 1% respectively. Finally, the clouds were created using the rect() function and the setAlpha() function to create the nice transparancy. The clouds use the mouse's X value and the millis() to move over time as well as respond to the user's mouse movement.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall a pretty fun assingment that really took advantage of my love for this kind of retro aesthetic. The reason I chose my overworl generator over my dungeon one is becuase my overworld genertor both looked and worked better than my dungeon one. I struggled a lot on the dungeon generator to make it feel like each seed could be a real level in a game. I mainly struggled with the room sizes, how to connect them, and getting items like doors and chests to look good inside them. 
					Once I decided to move on to the overworld generator, I started having much more fun as I already had a good idea of how things worked and wasn't contrained by too many borders and strict shapes. The noise function is godly and I will be using it at all tiems possible from now on.</p>
