				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>A Minecraft inspired infinite world generator that borrows minecraft's basic aesthetic and procedural generation to pay homage to the legendary game. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This generator has three key parts to it, the world key, the noies function, and the building of the blocks. The world key is generated by the XXH32 hashing function which is served into p5.js's noiseSeed function to keep track of each world that is generated.
					It does not feed the key into the randomSeed funciton because I did not use random() anywhere, it's all done with noise(). Speaking of, I used a pretty simple algorithm for the noise funciton to create a random yet coherent landscape, then used if statements to decide how the noise would create a world. 
					The world is made up of cubes that rise from the ground, corresponding to each tile's noise value. The cubes are made from the line() and quad() functions and wonderous joys of math. The colors for each part of the world were taken straight from their Minecraft counterpart.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project really tested my creativity, innovation, and time management. I had very little idea of what I was going to do in the begging and ended up taking on a creative endeavor that turned out to be a little too much to handle.
					I was a little frustrated when I resorted to using the grid system that came with the project tempalte, but I ended up turning it into something I really liked. I surprised myself several times during this project (thouht honestly I should have believed in myself a little more) while trying to come up with ways to achieve my vision.
					Though I think the most frustrating part of this whole thing was trying to come up with the two extra generators. I wanted the generators to be different from one another, however being innovative is quite difficult and time consuming, so I ended up settling for each generator being a showcase of eveloution across the process.
