				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project makes use of random mutation and annealing to create blury imitations of images.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>The inspiring images for this project were inspired by popular album covers that I personally selectedd (not that there are that many monochrome album covers)</li>
                    <li>The shapes that make up these imitations are created with an algorithm designed to make star shapes. The stars are very differnet from each other in terms of shape and size, which leads to interesting looking final imitations.</li>
                    <li>The way the generator renders the image leaves a lot to be desired in terms of accuracy but makes up for it in uniqueness.</li>
                </ol>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Annealing</h2>
                <p>When it comes to the slider and taking advantage of the annealing process, I recommend starting out at 100 but quickly moving down by around 20 percent after a few seconds. Do this until you are near 0, then leave it on 3 percent until you are satisfied with the result. I found that this method was the most efficient and led to the greatest results. 
                </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>A really fun assingment that mixed both personal preference and technical process to create varying unique results. Perhaps I could have spent a little more time on the mutation function, but got a little side tracked with other aspects of the process.</p>
